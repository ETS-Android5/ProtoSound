Introduction
------------
ProtoSound is an Android-based app designed for commercially available smartphone to provide customizable, always-available, and private sound feedback in multiple contexts. ProtoSound informs users about three key sound properties: sound identity, loudness, and time of occurrence through customizable sound alerts using visual and vibrational feedback. We use a deep learning-based sound classification engine (running on either the watch or on the paired phone or cloud) to continually sense and process sound events in real-time.
